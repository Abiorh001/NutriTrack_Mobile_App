2. **FastAPI**: FastAPI is used as the backend framework due to its high performance and scalability. It leverages asynchronous programming and modern Python features to provide fast and efficient API endpoints.

3. **MySQL Database**: The app uses MySQL as the relational database management system. MySQL offers robust data storage, retrieval, and query capabilities, making it suitable for managing user data, food information, and nutrition goals.

## Backend Development
The NutriTrack backend is developed using the FastAPI framework and MySQL database. FastAPI enables rapid API development with automatic documentation generation, input validation, and support for asynchronous operations. It offers high performance and handles a large number of concurrent requests efficiently.

The backend codebase is organized using the modular monolithic architecture. Each module represents a specific functionality or domain, such as authentication, user management, food logging, nutrition goal tracking, and integration with external APIs. This modular approach ensures code separation, reusability, and maintainability.

The MySQL database is utilized to store user data, including user profiles, food logs, nutrition goals, and other relevant information. The database schema is designed to establish appropriate relationships between tables, enabling efficient data retrieval and updates.

## Conclusion
The NutriTrack mobile app provides users with a powerful tool to track their daily calorie intake, set personalized nutrition goals, make informed food choices, access expert nutrition tips, and gain insights into their overall nutritional intake. With its modular monolithic architecture, FastAPI backend, and MySQL database, the app offers a scalable and efficient solution for promoting healthier lifestyles.

By leveraging cutting-edge technologies and focusing on user experience, NutriTrack empowers individuals to take control of their nutrition and achieve their wellness objectives.
